# Conclusion

Thank you for participating in the workshop!

That brings us to the conclusion of this workshop. We've navigated the landscape of continuous integration and deployment using Tekton and ArgoCD, all within the reliable infrastructure provided by Equinix Metal. We've delved into the intricacies of setting up and managing a robust environment, deployed an engaging web application, and experienced firsthand the power of these tools in a harmonious CI/CD pipeline.

ArgoCD, acting as the reliable manager of deployments, and Tekton, serving as the dependable facilitator of continuous integration, have demonstrated their exceptional ability to automate and manage deployments. Their adaptability, combined with the solid foundation of Equinix Metal, offer a solution that can smoothly adjust to meet evolving needs.

Remember, you’ve just begun to explore the vast realm of CI/CD pipelines. You’ve gotten a taste of how these tools can harmoniously work together on Equinix Metal, creating a productive and scalable CI/CD system.
